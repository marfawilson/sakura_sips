# Sakura Sips üå∏

This is a personal project I've started in order to apply the things I've learned through self-studying. I'm actively working on this website, constantly adding new features & making changes. With that in mind, my code and layout may not be perfect, but the journey of learning & implementing new concepts is more important than looks, which are subjective anyways. I'm happy when a new concept clicks and I can find a way to properly implement it to achieve the result I want.
